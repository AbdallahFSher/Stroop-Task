v1.05 (June 12, 2024)
    - Added fullscreen
    - Centered word
    - Added popup window for easy subject data input
    - Changed font from 48 to 72
    Known Bugs:
        - Occasionally, the screen will stay black even though a word is selected, and a new word doesn't appear until about 2.5 seconds afterwards
            (total length of stimulus + inter-stimulus interval). This could be a rendering issue due to messy code; Need to fix in the next couple
            of days.
